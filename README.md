    - Add a file to your local repo and "commit" (save) the changes
    - "Push" your changes to your branch
    - In Github desktop, choose which files to commit and add a message
    - "Pull" the changes to your local machine
    
    - Open a "pull request" (propose changes to the main branch)
    - "Merge" your branch to the main branch
